# Pyber_Analysis

Analysis of the Ride-Sharing Company Pyber

Overview of the analysis:
	The purpose of the attached analysis is to outline the different Pyber fares, rider counts, and driver counts in 3 different city environments. 
These environments are Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and the breakdowns and comparisions comprise the bulk of the analysis.


Results:
	Through various methodolgies, I have found that the company's product (rideshares), is a vastly different system when viewed 
across all environments. The first figure in my analysis is a scatter plot of the 3 environments which shows the correlation between Average Fare and 
Number of Rides per City. The sizes relate to the amount of rides in any given city.

The second figure shows the total of rides per environment, with the only outlier being 39 rides in one city. There are far more rides in the Urban 
city type than the others.

The next figure shows the total fares across all three of the city types. This shows that Suburban has the smallest range of fares, but the highest 
fares are in the Rural cities.

The next figure shows the total amount of drivers per city in each type. It shows that the most drivers are in the Urban setting, at about 2/3 more than Suburban.
Rural cities have 2/3 less than Suburban ones do.

The pie chart of shows percentage of total fare by city type. Urban comprises 62.7% of the fares, Suburban is 30.5%, and Rural comes in at 6.8%.

The next pie chart shows the percentage of total rides by city type. Urban has 68.4% of the rides, Suburban has 26.3, and Rural has 5.3%.

The final pie chart shows the percentage of total drivers per city type. Urban has 80.9% of the drivers, Suburban has 16.5%, and Rura has 2.6%.

Summary:
Rural
	When looking at the data, my first recommendation is to cut the Rural city types from service. They do not comprise enough of the riders, fares, or drivers to properly justify expanding in these cities. 
Suburban
	My second recommendation is to offer lower fares in the suburban city types to entice more riders to use the service, thus booting riders, fares, and by extension, drivers to fill the need. There is enough of a base of drivers to justify this in the Suburban areas. 
Urban
	My third recommendation is to streamline fares in the Urban cities. To better support the huge amount of riders, we need more drivers. i believe that we should offer a program to the drivers to boots fares recieved based on how many riders they carry. This will encourage some drivers to increase their time on the road with our company, and will increase popular opinion of our company, which will in turn continue to boost all of the fares, riders, and drivers in the Urban cities.


This final figure shows the correlation between Fares in all 3 environments for a span of 4 months. 
Fares in Urban cities start less than $1500 in Janurary, and topped out around $2500 2 months later where it stayed for 2 months.
Fares in Suburban cities start around $750 in Janurary, top out in March around $1400, and continue this cycle agin 2 months later. 
Fares in Rural cities start around $300 in January, where they mostly stay, peaking around $400 at the end of February, dip, and then reach around $500 at the beginning of April.
