# Pyber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
	The purpose of the attached analysis is to outline the different Pyber fares, rider counts, and driver counts in 3 different city environments. 
These environments are Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and the breakdowns and comparisions comprise the bulk of the analysis.

Results:
	Through various methodolgies, I have found that the company's product (rideshares), is a vastly different system when viewed 
across all environments. 

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, 
total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
